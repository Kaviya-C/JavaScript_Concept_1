// Template literal
// why do we needed ?

let num1=5;
let num2=4;
let result=num1+num2;

// here we are giving quotation where needed to print num1 and num2 for this complication we have solution that template literal
console.log("Addition of "+num1 +" and "+ num2 +" is: "+result);


//template literal
console.log(`addition of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${result}`);

// ${} --- mention which variable should come
console.log("My name is\n Kaviya");
// this double quotes and \n make the text to print in next line

console.log(`my name is
KAVIYA`);// instead of using above \n we can use bactick and which line u want to display that structure give inside the backtrip
